WCAO San Juan River Basin Daily Operations Model

The latest version of the SJRB Daily Ops model is updated here, along with the current ruleset. This model is updated frequently as improvements to Riverware 
and/or methods are made.  

The Min/Most/Max runs of the 24-Month Study (current month) are also posted here. These runs are considered to be in "draft" format and can be revised. They are 
considered final once the 24-MOnth Study is published (around the middle of each month).
