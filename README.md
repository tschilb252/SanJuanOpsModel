#WCAO San Juan River Basin Daily Operations Model

The latest version of the San Juan River Basin 24-Month Study and MRM Ops model is updated here, along with the current ruleset. This model is updated frequently as improvements to Riverware 
and/or methods are made.  

The Min/Most/Max runs of the San Juan inputs to the 24-Month Study (current month) are also posted here. These runs are posted for informational purposes, and are revised as needed until the 24-Month Study is published.
